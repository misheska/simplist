# Simplist

Simplist is an incredibly simple to-do list app built with Ruby on Rails. Its primary purpose is to be a demo of web/CSS animations, mostly using the new [dynamics.js](http://dynamicsjs.com/) library. I've done lots of animations on iOS, but wanted to see what was possible in the web now that there is a physics-based animation library.
